        LeTub Saloon has been safely tucked away on A1A behind lush greenery,
        that even people who have lived in Hollywood for years, have unknowingly
        driven right past. For the last 32 years it has been a refuge to a large
        handful of lucky locals, whom either found it while boating on the
        Intercoastal Waterway or informed by word of mouth, for there were no
        signs and no advertising.

        LeTub has been impressing people for many years and for many reasons.The
        food(all of it)has always been outstanding, no matter what you choose to
        eat.We offer many one of a kind recipes you won’t find anywhere else,
        including our Seafood Gumbo the House Salad Dressing, and Key Lime Pie
        that has always been made on premisesand the recipes have never been
        differed.The only thing that has differed is our recent claim to fame in
        2006 when GQ gave our Burger #1 in the nation. We know what a honor that
        is and truly appreciate it, yet we believe that LeTub should remain
        impressing people for the same reasons it always has. And for the people
        who appreciate the food and atmosphere that took years and hard work to
        establish, and so many come here to enjoy.We surly hope that if you have
        some extra time on your hands you will come and enjoy what the locals
        already get…..A little slice of Heaven on Hollywood Beach
